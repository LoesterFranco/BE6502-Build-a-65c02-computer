# 6502 Bus Monitor

This is essentially identical to the Arduino Sketch provided by Ben Eater for his *Build a 6502 computer* video series, the only thing I've done is put it in a folder and try not to call it my own. I don't know if it'll be featured in any of his future videos, but for reference this was the file made available after the third video in the series. His original files along with the accompanying videos can be found at his web page at https://eater.net/6502.
