# TODO
There is always things to do, but not enough time for everything. I've tried to maintain a list of outstanding tasks below, organized by module.

## Clock module
- Manual clock is somewhat flaky, but it is the same as the one used in the videos so I assume this is part of the design. Will probably make some alterations to it when the video series have been completed.

## SBC
- Make necessary changes when final video drops.
- Reset circuit as specified in the video series is insufficient for running at reasonable speeds, ie. anything other than using the slow clock. This'll be redesigned if not part of final design when final videos are released.
